  - Allows to immediatly invalidate a login token.
- Message | Get
  - Requires Authentication
  - Comes in two variants:
  - Before: Returns X amount of messages before the given date
  - After: Returns X amount of messages after the given date
  - The ammount of messages can be configured. Since the messages will have the dates they were sent on attached to them, this works as a way to paginate the results.
- Message | Post
  - Requires Authentication
  - Allows sending of a message.
- Connect | WebSocket
  - Requires Authentication
  - Connecting to the websocket should allow the client to easily send messages to the server and receives updates for new messages as they come in. This eliminates the requirements for continously needing to poll the server for updates.
